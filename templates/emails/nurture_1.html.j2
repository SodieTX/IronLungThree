    <p>Hi {{ prospect.first_name }},</p>
    
    <p>I wanted to share a quick thought that might be relevant to 
    {{ company.name }}.</p>
    
    <p>We've been seeing a lot of lenders struggle with manual processes 
    eating up their team's time. The ones who've automated their borrower 
    intake are seeing 30-40% faster close times.</p>
    
    <p>If that's something you're thinking about, I'd be happy to show you 
    what's working for other shops in your space.</p>
    
    <p>No pressure either way — just wanted to plant the seed.</p>
