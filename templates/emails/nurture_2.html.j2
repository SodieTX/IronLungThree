    <p>Quick question — what's the biggest bottleneck in your loan process
    right now?</p>

    <p>I ask because we work with a lot of
    {% if company.loan_types %}{{ company.loan_types | join(', ') }}{% else %}private{% endif %}
    lenders, and the pain points tend to cluster around a few common areas:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Borrower document collection</li>
        <li>Manual data entry between systems</li>
        <li>Tracking deal status across the team</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If any of those resonate, I'd love to hear what you're dealing with.
    Sometimes a 10-minute call can surface ideas you hadn't considered.</p>
