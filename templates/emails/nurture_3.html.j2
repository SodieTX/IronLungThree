    <p>Hi {{ prospect.first_name }},</p>
    
    <p>I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back, so I'll keep 
    this short.</p>
    
    <p>If now's not the right time for {{ company.name }} to look at new 
    technology, no worries at all. These things have their own timing.</p>
    
    <p>If something changes down the road — new pain point, budget cycle, 
    whatever — feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to help.</p>
    
    <p>Wishing you a strong quarter ahead.</p>
    
    <p>{{ sender.name }}</p>
