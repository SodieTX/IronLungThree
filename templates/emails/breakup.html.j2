    <p>{{ prospect.first_name }},</p>

    <p>I've tried to reach you a few times without any luck, so I'm going
    to assume the timing isn't right.</p>

    <p>I'll close out my file on {{ company.name }} for now, but if
    circumstances change — new initiative, budget approval, whatever —
    my door's always open.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your time, and best of luck with everything.</p>

    <p>{{ sender.name }}</p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: #666;">
    P.S. If I've just been hitting the wrong inbox or you've been slammed,
    no hard feelings. Just reply "still interested" and we'll pick up
    where we left off.
